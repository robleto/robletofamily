    <small>Dad on his only trip with us to Deep Creek Lake, doing what he did best, making people laugh.</small>
    <p class="dad">Early 2022 was consumed with the declining health and eventual passing of Greg's dad on March 9, 2022. In the months prior, we tried to take as much advantage as we could of our time with him, and created memories that will be cherished forever.  Our hearts were completely broken by the loss and we were deeply touched and grateful for our expansive support network.</p>
    
    <img src="/img/2022/memorial/bailey.jpg" class="bailey-photo">
    <p class="bailey">Exactly four months to the day after one loss, we suffered another. This time, it was our dear dog Bailey. We had some rocky beginnings but he provied to be the most loyal pet we have ver had. We love dhim so hard, and vice versa.</p>

    <h2>Highlight of 2022</h2>

    <p class="lede"><strong>By November</strong> we were ready for a major espace, when Selena's brother Dean suggested we see him in the Middle East, we gladly accepted. It was a much needed respite, a cultural awakening, and an adventure of a lifetime.</p>

    <aside class="bahrain">
        <h3>Bahrain</h3>
        <p>See this tiny country? This is where Dean is stationed. See this photo? We are sitting on his back patio. We woke up that morning taking a jump into the canal and palleboarding and kayaking</p>
